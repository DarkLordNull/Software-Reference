## Video Capture

Windows 10 has a built-in recorder which can capture video and audio from any single application except File Explorer (which also means it cannot capture the desktop). It is part of the Xbox game bar panel, which can be accessed by pressing `Win` + `G`. To start or stop a recording press `Win` + `Alt` + `R`. Note that the recording is ended automatically if focus is switched away from the application that is being recorded. Nonetheless, this is useful for capturing gameplay (or just game music). Recordings are stored at `C:\Users\<username>\Videos\Captures`.
